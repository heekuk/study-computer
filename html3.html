    <h1>A high-level definition</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows<br> 
    you to implement complex features on web pages </p> <p>every time
     a web page does more than just sit there and display static<br> 
     information for you to look at — displaying timely content<br> 
     updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling<br>
     video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably<br>
     involved.</p><p> It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web <br>
     technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in <br>
     much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
